# This script contains configuration specific to the llm-foundry
# environment. It is split into three sections:
#
# 1. configuration for the PROJECT directory, meaning long-term
#    storage such as for code repositories.
# 2. configuration for the SCRATCH directory, meaning short-term
#    storage such as for binaries, preprocessed data, or model
#    checkpoints.
# 3. configuration for this directory, so that it's easy to make all
#    supercomputer-specific scripts refer to the same file.
